      <p class="intro">In 2020, with the devestating COVID pandemic, many sports fans have not been tunning into watch major sporting events. For the NBA Finals, the viewership has been decreasing since 2016 and has reached an average low of 7.5
        million viewers this year, nearly half compared to the year before. Similarly, baseball’s World Series has seen a
        significant decrease from 2016 with just 9.7 million people tuning in to watch it. The NFL’s first Sunday night football game, which usually draws large numbers, has also been affected this year, although not as much. And, the UEFA Champions
        League Final, which is watched worldwide, has seen a slight decrease this year in average viewership.</p>


      <p> Jon Lewis, who has been covering sports media and viewership for all major sports for 14 years, believes that the COVID pandemic and the lack of fans has had some effect on all the numbers.

        “I wouldn't say it's the primary factor, but in general it's a more subdued atmosphere. I do think the lack of fans did have some impact on it, I would imagine."</p>

      <p> Sports viewership in major sports events in basketball, baseball, football, and soccer has been significantly low in recent years. This year, the number of people watching major sports events has gone down. The COVID pandemic may have
        affected the numbers this year due to the lack of fans attending games and due to the coverage that COVID was getting.</p>
